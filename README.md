# HTL-Party Project Description

The fun party game for HTL students!

## Static Part

For the static part, we are researching how to create an online multiplayer browser game. This can be a complex topic and we will most likely use all subtopics of it in our Dynamic Part (the web app).
##### Here is a wireframe diagram, showcasing a sketch for some sites in the project.

## Dynamic Part

For the Dynamic Part, our Plan is to create "HTL-Party", which is an exciting web game inspired by the popular Mario Party series, but as an online multiplayer web game. This project aims to provide an engaging and entertaining experience for HTL (HÃ¶here Technische Lehranstalt) students. This also helps them to socialize more with other students and study HTL subjects in fun ways.

### Game Start
- Players choose their Character (if someone else didn't already choose it)

### Main Game 
- Game loop:
    1. All players will be asked if they want to use their ability (if they have it available) 
    2. Every Player takes a turn
        - Player turn:
            1. The player rolls the dice
            2. The player moves as many fields as the dice shows
            3. If the player stands on an action field, the corresponding actian will be executed
    3. A random Minigame starts
        1. Player's will get instructions for the minigame

        3. Minigame starts playing

    - Possible ending requirements (set by the host):
