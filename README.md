# HTL-Party

## Description and Goals of the Project

HTL-Party is an exciting web game inspired by the popular Mario Party series. This project aims to provide an engaging and entertaining experience for HTL (HÃ¶here Technische Lehranstalt) students. This also helps them to socialize more with other students and study HTL subjects in fun ways.

### Static Part

In the static part of this project, we will create a visually appealing website to introduce the concept and provide essential information. The website will consist of plain HTML and CSS, offering a user-friendly interface to visitors. The key components of the static part include:

- **The Idea and Description of Your Project**

    -  HTL-Party is a web-based multiplayer game that brings students together for a fun and educational experience. It is designed to mimic the format of Mario Party, a well-known party video game series, while incorporating elements relevant to HTL students' interests and coursework.

- **Wireframe Diagram**

    - We have created a wireframe diagram for the static website using draw.io, ensuring a clear and intuitive layout. This diagram will serve as a blueprint for the website's design, enabling students to easily navigate and understand the game's concept.

- **Audience**

    - The primary audience for our website includes HTL students and staff. We want to create an accessible and inclusive platform that can be enjoyed by students of all ages. The website will feature content and games that resonate with HTL students, making it an engaging and relevant resource for the entire HTL community.

### Dynamic Part:

In the dynamic part of the project, we will focus on the web application development using JavaScript and Web APIs. This part will be closely aligned with the static part to maintain a consistent theme. The key components of the dynamic part include:

- **The Idea and Functionality of Your Web Application**

    HTL-Party is not just a regular web game; it's an educational and entertaining experience. The web application will feature:

    - **Multiplayer Mini-Games** Students can join or host multiplayer mini-games that are really fun and engaging. Some of these games will test knowledge and skills in various HTL subjects, while others are just for pure engagement!

    - **Character Selection** Players can choose from many funny looking characters, that make them stand out from others.

    - **Game Progression** Like Mario Party, the game will progress through different boards or stages, where players complete challenges/minigames and earn points.

    - **Leaderboards** A feature that keeps track of the top-performing students and encourages friendly competition.

    - **Educational Resources** In addition to gaming, the website will provide links to educational resources and information related to HTL fields.
