        <h1>How to play:</h1>
        <p>The concept is simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll the dice</li>
            <li>Your character moves as many fields as you rolled</li>
            <li>After everyone did their turn, a random Minigame starts</li>
            <li>If you perform better in the Minigame, your ability will be charged more</li>
            <li>Use these Items to either slow down your oppenents, or to protect yourself from them</li>
            <li>First person that gets to the finish line, wins!</li>
        </ol>
