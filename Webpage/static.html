                    Platform fighter is a video game subgenre of fighting games that cover games that emphasize fighting on stages with free 2D movement, similar to a platform game. The "Platform" part acknowledges the platformer-like freedom of movement and potential stage design. "Fighter" nods towards competitive fighting games between human players in general.

                In platform fighting games, matches occur on a flat surface with floating platforms for players to use strategically. Players can move freely in various directions, jump, double jump, or even fly. Victory conditions vary, such as depleting an opponent's health, knocking them off the stage, or earning the most points. Most games in this genre, inspired by Super Smash Bros, use a damage percentage system to show how far a player will be pushed when attacked, aiming to send them out of the stage boundaries.

                    The animation is the foundation to your fighting game and the visual effects, sound effects, hitpause, camera effects, and other game feel additions are the dressing.

                <h2>Why Balance Games?</h2>
                <p>Balancing characters is tough because developers want to keep the character feeling the same even after changes. Characters usually get either a nerf (making them weaker) or a buff (making them stronger). Completely redoing a character is rare because it means starting from scratch, not just tweaking values like damage.</p>

                <h2>The pros and cons of characters</h2>
                <p>n a fair fighting game, characters have different strengths and weaknesses. It's important that each character wins and loses an equal number of matchups to maintain balance. Developers use matchups to check if a character is generally better or worse than others.</p>

                <h2>Metas</h2>
                <p>
                    Metas, the strongest strategies in fighting games, evolve rapidly due to constant developer balancing. In older, unupdateable games, players exploiting Metas can be frustrating for opponents. Presently, annoying Metas persist, like "spam" characters in games such as Brawlhalla, where repetitive attacks can overwhelm opponents with limited counterplay.</p>

                    It's tricky to make adjustments to a character's abilities without losing what makes them unique. Some characters are supposed to feel very slow but heavy-hitting, but completely changing that would require a rework of the character, which would be a lot of work and make fans of the characters mad.
