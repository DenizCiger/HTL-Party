            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Platform fighter is a video game subgenre of fighting games that cover games that emphasize fighting on stages with free 2D movement, similar to a platform game.
            The "Platform" part acknowledges the platformer-like freedom of movement and potential stage design. "Fighter" nods towards competitive fighting games between human players in general.

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        Matches take place on a 2D plane, usually on a stage with platforms floating around for the player to use for better movement or attacks. Movement is similar to platform games, where the player is able to move in any direction they like and be able to jump, double jump, or even fly depending on the game. While there have been many games that have been labeled platform fighters, they all generally feature different requirements to achieve victory. This can range from depleting an opponent's health bar, as in most traditional fighting games; knocking out the opponent off the stage; or getting the most points in a match. Many games in the genre have adopted the system pioneered by the Super Smash Bros. series, in which a damage percentage is displayed which indicates how far a player will be knocked back when attacked, in hopes of sending them beyond the stage boundaries.

            <h3>Animations</h3>
            Animations are important for a good fighting game.
            So every character should have an idle, jump and animations for every attack.
            The animation is the foundation to your fighting game and the visual effects, sound effects, hitpause, camera effects, and other game feel additions are the dressing.

            It is important that the characters are easily recognizable.
            So characters should be different from the background.

            Music in a Platform-Fighting-Game also plays a vital role in setting the tone, enhancing the gaming experience, and complementing the fast-paced action of the gameplay.
            The music is generally energetic and upbeat, matching the fast and dynamic nature of the gameplay.
            It helps maintain a high level of excitement throughout matches.
            The genre often leans towards electronic, rock, or a fusion of different styles that amplify the intensity of the battles.
            When music adopt to the on-screen action, then it is called a dynamic music system. The music can variate based on factors like time left, players alive or the intensity of the combat.
            The backgroundmusic can also be based on the stage.
            So every stage can have custom background tracks appropriate to their theme.
            Every character may have their own victory music, wich play when they win a game.
