1. Gameplay Mechanics

	Specific "gametype": Platform fighter
	
	Objective: Knock other players off the stage.
		This helps you do that: (When writing the final text, you MUST consider that this has to describe multiple games and not OUR game)

	  	* Knockback: is dealt to characters if they are attacked | Knockback varies from attack to attack and changes dependent on the game.
    		* Attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack (for example, a dash or uppercut).
    		* Charge attacks: normally need to be charged before using | Dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction and normally deal more knockback than normal attacks.
    		* Special attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack | Special + up normally is some sort of way to gain height.
    		* Air attacks: are not in every game but usually are normal/heavy/sometimes special attacks triggered while in the air | They normally work a bit differently than their counterparts on the ground.
    		* Items: are not in every game but normally change the functionality to your character's moveset when collected.

	Boundarys: When do you loose?
		the player is eliminated/losing a live (dependent on the game) as soon as he leaves the map in any way. Leaving the map means that the player isn´t visible on the camera anymore or leaves a small area surounding the camera.
		This is normaly paired with a effect that shows all players that the player was eliminated.

2. Character Design
	* Character Silhouette
		The silhouette of the character is their shape and outline. It can help to convey their personality, abilities, and role in the game. A good character silhouette should be distinctive, recognizable, and expressive.
	* Character Moveset
		This is the set of attacks and abilities that a character can use in combat. A good character moveset should be balanced, diverse, and fun to use.
	* Character Customization
		This is the feature that allows players to change the appearance and/or abilities of a character. A good character customization should be flexible, creative, and rewarding. For example, some games have characters with different skins, colors, and weapons that players can unlock and choose.
3. Graphics and Animation
	* Animations
		Animations are important for a good fighting game.
		So every character should have an idle, jump and animations for every attack.
		The animation is the foundation to your fighting game and the visual effects, sound effects, hitpause, camera effects, and other game feel additions are the dressing.
	* Graphics
		In the last years the graphics of platform fighting games became better and more graphically impressive.
		It is important that the characters are easily recognizable.
		So characters should be different from the background.

4. Multiplayer and Online Features

5. Sound and Music
	* Soundeffects:
		In a Platform-Fighting-Game, sound effects play a crucial role in enhancing the overall gaming experience and providing feedback to players.
		Examples for Soundeffects:
			* Character Movements
			* Attacks
			* Hits and Damage
			* Projectiles and Weapons
	* Music
		Music in a Platform-Fighting-Game also plays a vital role in setting the tone, enhancing the gaming experience, and complementing the fast-paced action of the gameplay.
		The music is generally energetic and upbeat, matching the fast and dynamic nature of the gameplay.
		It helps maintain a high level of excitement throughout matches.
		The genre often leans towards electronic, rock, or a fusion of different styles that amplify the intensity of the battles.
		When music adopt to the on-screen action, then it is called a dynamic music system. The music can variate based on factors like time left, players alive or the intensity of the combat.
		The backgroundmusic can also be based on the stage.
		So every stage can have custom background tracks appropriate to their theme.
		Every character may have their own victory music, which plays when they win a game.
6. Game Balance and Updates
	1. "Überschrift"

	Balancing characters is tough because developers want to keep the character feeling the same even after changes. Characters usually get either a nerf (making them weaker) or a buff (making them better). 		Completely redoing a character is rare 		because it means starting from scratch, not just tweaking things like damage.

	2. Fine-Tuning Strengths:
	
	Developers work on adjusting the strengths of characters to create a varied group.
	This includes characters who are quick and nimble and others who are strong and hit hard.
	Challenges of Changing Abilities:

	3. Challanges

	It's tricky to make adjustments to a character's abilities without losing what makes them unique.
	Developers face difficulties in finding the right balance to keep each character interesting and fair.
	Ensuring a Fun Experience:

	4. Goal

	The goal is to balance things so that the game stays enjoyable for everyone.
	Finding the right balance prevents certain characters from being too strong and makes the game more fun for all players.
