1. Gameplay Mechanics

	Specific "gametype": Platform fighter
	
	Objective: Knock other players off the stage.
		This helps you do that: (When writing the final text, you MUST consider that this has to describe multiple games and not OUR game)

	  	* Knockback: which is dealt to characters if they are attacked | Knockback varies from attack to attack and changes dependent on the game.
    		* Attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack (for example, a dash or uppercut).
    		* Charge attacks: normally need to be charged before using | Dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction and normally deal more knockback than normal attacks.
    		* Special attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack | Special + up normally is some sort of way to gain height.
    		* Air attacks: are not in every game but usually are normal/heavy/sometimes special attacks triggered while in the air | They normally work a bit differently than their counterparts on the ground.
    		* Items: are not in every game but normally change the functionality to your character's moveset when collected.

	Boundarys: When is someone eliminated/losing a life
		the player is eliminated/losing a live (dependent on the game) as soon as he leaves the map in any way. Leaving the map means that the player isn´t visible on the camera anymore or leaves a small area 		surounding the camera. This is normaly paired with a effect that shows all players that the "Opfer" was eliminated.
