1. Gameplay Mechanics

	Specific "gametype": Platform fighter
	
	Objective: Knock other players off the stage.
		This helps you do that: (When writing the final text, you MUST consider that this has to describe multiple games and not OUR game)

	  	* Knockback: is dealt to characters if they are attacked | Knockback varies from attack to attack and changes dependent on the game.
    		* Attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack (for example, a dash or uppercut).
    		* Charge attacks: normally need to be charged before using | Dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction and normally deal more knockback than normal attacks.
    		* Special attacks: dependent on the game, they can be combined with a direction to trigger a specific attack | Special + up normally is some sort of way to gain height.
    		* Air attacks: are not in every game but usually are normal/heavy/sometimes special attacks triggered while in the air | They normally work a bit differently than their counterparts on the ground.
    		* Items: are not in every game but normally change the functionality to your character's moveset when collected.

	Boundarys: When is someone eliminated/losing a life
		the player is eliminated/losing a live (dependent on the game) as soon as he leaves the map in any way. Leaving the map means that the player isn´t visible on the camera anymore or leaves a small area 		surounding the camera. This is normaly paired with a effect that shows all players that the "Opfer" was eliminated.

5. Sound and Music
	* Soundeffects:
		In a Platform-Fighting-Game, sound effects play a crucial role in enhancing the overall gaming experience and providing feedback to players.
		Examples for Soundeffects:
			* Character Movements
			* Attacks
			* Hits and Damages
			* Projectiles and Weapons
	* Music
		Music in a Platform-Fighting-Game also plays a vital role in setting the tone, enhancing the gaming experience, and complementing the fast-paced action of the gameplay.
        The music is generally energetic and upbeat, matching the fast and dynamic nature of the gameplay.
        It helps maintain a high level of excitement throughout matches.
        The genre often leans towards electronic, rock, or a fusion of different styles that amplify the intensity of the battles.
        When music adopt to the on-screen action, then it is called a dynamic music system. The music can variate based on factors like time left, players alive or the intensity of the combat.
        The backgroundmusic can also be based on the stage.
        So every stage can have custom background tracks appropriate to their theme.
        Every character may have their own victory music, wich play when they win a game.
